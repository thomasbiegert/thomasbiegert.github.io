      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m an Assistant Professor in International Social and Public Policy in the Department for Social Policy at the London School of Economics (LSE). I obtained my Ph.D. in Sociology from the Graduate School for Economic and Social Sciences at the University of Mannheim in 2014. Before coming to LSE in 2017 I held a position as post-doctoral researcher at the WZB Berlin Social Science Center.
My main research interests are in the fields of comparative social policy and social inequality, combined with a strong interest in research methods and research design.</description>
